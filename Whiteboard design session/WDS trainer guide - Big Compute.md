# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking

-   Involves the participant in the learning process

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants)

-   Ensures individual participant accountability

-   Ties it all together for the participant

-   Provides insight and experience into the learning process

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables

-   Effectively leads the feedback process

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

Outcome: Analyze your customer's needs

-   Customer's background, situation, needs, and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives, and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

Outcome: Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution

-   Design and diagram your solution

-   Prepare to present your solution

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

Outcome: Present solution to your customer.

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objection

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions

-   Before the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas

-   Make notes for later

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

#  Big Compute whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

Setup and configure a scale-out media processing architecture using Azure Batch. You will use big compute (scale-out compute, embarrassingly parallel processing) techniques without having to write a lot of code, learning how these tasks can be accomplished declaratively.

Learning Objectives:

-   Learn the core capabilities of Azure Batch

-   Understand how to author custom Pool and Job templates

-   Work with Job input and output files

-   Learn to author Batch auto-scale formulas

-   Leverage Batch Labs and the Azure Portal for management and monitoring

-   Use Marketplace applications to simplify common big compute tasks, such as 3D rendering

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome** 

Analyze your customer’s needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips. 
1.  Meet your table participants and trainer 
2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide 
3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study

### Customer situation

ThoughtRender provides image and video processing services to many industries -- marketing and advertising, retail, medical, and media and entertainment. You know those furniture magazines you love to look at? Most of the pictures in these magazines are generated by the HPC compute clusters at ThoughtRender. Their unique ability to tie together industry solutions into a reliable service for their customers (e.g., furniture magazine designers! 3D animated movie makers!), together with their in-house knowledge on image and video, is a quality service that sets them apart from competitors.

ThoughtRender currently operates their own, on-premises services (with their own on-premises HPC clusters, and other IT infrastructure), but their success has led to challenges in terms of their growth, and ability to scale to new jobs, and new industries. They are curious about cloud and think that not only could it help them scale, but help them improve costs and pass savings to customers, address the seasonality of rendering demand (by only paying for resources when actually used) and to take advantage of new technologies, such as the latest GPUs.

Customers often ask questions like, "Could you get that job processed this week, instead of in 3 weeks' time?" ThoughtRender thinks that perhaps bursting jobs to the cloud could help them deliver bigger jobs, or regular jobs quicker for their customers (e.g., in 1 day, instead of 5 days). They intend to pilot a solution to address this.

They also want to consider how to integrate with their on-premises infrastructure and operating model. They have three large on-premises HPC clusters -- one in each site -- London, New York, and Singapore. They also have labs in each site that provide high-end visualization workstations for quality control, mostly operated by internal staff, but sometimes together with customers. ThoughtRender have 3 petabytes (PB) of data (customer assets, and working "scratch" data shares) -- 1 PB typically stored per site.

Thomas Pix, CIO of ThoughtRender is looking to modernize their story. He would love to understand how to tap into the \"power of the cloud\" to be more flexible to customer demands, but also to consider new ways of working. Lots of data is generated via their on-premises HPC clusters, which also spends a lot of time moving between sites. He would love to see if they can move this data away from their on-premises datacenter into the cloud, and enhance their ability to load, process, and analyze it going forward. Given his long-standing relationship with Microsoft, he would like to see if Azure can meet his needs.

### Customer needs 

1.  Want to be able to provide better flexibility to their customer demands (i.e., to have more work processed, or to complete work in a faster time)

2.  Want to investigate potential advantages to using cloud (e.g., latest technologies, bursting capability, cost savings)

3.  Want to integrate with their on-premises systems where possible (e.g., to burst to cloud for additional capacity)

4.  Want to collaborate and visualize the results of their work, on their own, or together with customers

### Customer objections 

1.  Will Azure give us control to schedule jobs when we want?

2.  Will the capacity be available on Azure when we want it?

3.  We heard Microsoft does Linux now. But how true is this? Will it work with our chosen Linux version?

4.  We have petabytes of data on-premises. It would cost us a fortune and take ages to move this to the cloud!

5.  We heard collaboration is possible for 3D imaging workstations, but we have very specific color requirements and buy top-end workstation equipment for our users. Our users just wouldn\'t get the interaction performance they require with something \"remote\" in the cloud.

6.  Will this take jobs away from our IT system administrators and HPC engineers?

### Infographic for common scenarios

High-performance computing (HPC) applications can scale to thousands of compute cores, extend on-premises big compute, or run as a 100% cloud-native solution. This HPC solution is implemented with Azure Batch, which provides job scheduling, auto-scaling of compute resources, and execution management as a platform service (PaaS) that reduces HPC infrastructure code and maintenance.

![In this Common HPC scenario diagram, A Web App and Client app have bi-directional arrows pointing to Batch, which has a bi-directional arrow pointing to Virtual Machines, which has bi-directional arrows pointing to Storage. Microsoft and Linux icons also display.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BigComputeimages/media/image2.png "Common HPC scenario diagram")

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome** 
Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format. 

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart. 
1.  Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers? 
2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design** 
Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart.

*High-level architecture*

1.  Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for data loading, data preparation, storage, machine learning modeling, and reporting. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.

*Data loading*

1.  How would you recommend ThoughtRender get their data into (and out of) Azure? What services would you suggest and what are the specific steps they would need to take to prepare the data, to transfer the data, and where would the loaded data land?

2.  Update your diagram with the data loading process with the steps you identified.

*Video and Image Processing*

1.  What software tools will be used here? Are they commercial, or Open Source, or a combination of both? Will ThoughtRender need to throw away the tools they are already using, or are some integrations possible?

2.  For Linux based tools, does it matter which flavor of Linux is chosen?

3.  When are these tools used at ThoughtRender? Are they part of a workflow?

*Batch Computing*

1.  What technology would you recommend ThoughtRender use for implementing their rendering compute workloads in Azure?

2.  Are there particular types of compute instances you would guide ThoughtRender to use?
    
3.  Are compute-intensive, memory-intensive, disk-intensive, or network-optimized instances needed?

4.  Are GPU based instances needed?

5.  How would you guide ThoughtRender to load data so it can be processed by the rendering compute workload?

6.  How will this data be used at the beginning, middle, and end of a compute workload?

7.  Where will this data be stored?

8.  Will this data be stored on compute instances during a batch run? Would you store data on each compute node working in a batch, or would you store data in a shared area?

9.  What sort of performance will be required from this storage?

10.  Will this data need to be backed up or archived?


*Operationalizing and Integrating*

1.  Is it possible for ThoughtRender to connect their Batch Rendering workloads in Azure, to their Rendering workloads on-premises, in their various sites? If so, will the connection be made at a networking level, an operating system level, or an application level?

2.  Is it possible for ThoughtRender to keep their Azure infrastructure separate (i.e., completely unconnected) to their on-premises HPC clusters?

*Visualization and Remote Workstations*

1.  Are special types of compute instances needed for remote workstations in Azure?

2.  Is a special type of software required for client access? Could users simply use remote desktop? Would this perform the way ThoughtRender (or their customers) would like it to?

3.  Would it be secure?

4.  Would it be color correct?

5.  Would it perform?

6.  Would it allow collaboration or interactivity?

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table: 

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution
2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.
3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer’s objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer. 

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**
 
Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

1.  Pair with another table
2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer
3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer
4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections
5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection
6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.
7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2–6

##  Wrap-up

# Big compute whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

-   Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer

-   Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"

-   Briefly review the steps and time frames of the whiteboard design session

-   Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

-   Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time

-   Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own

-   Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own

## Step 3: Present the solution

-   Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins

    -   For the first round, assign one table as the Microsoft team and the other table as the customer

-   Have the Microsoft team present their solution to the customer team

    -   Have the customer team provide one objection to which the Microsoft team to respond

    -   The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes

    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback

## Wrap-up

-   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution

##  Preferred target audience

Thomas Pix, CIO of ThoughtRender.

The primary audience is business decision makers and technology decision makers. Usually, we talk to the Infrastructure Managers who report to the CIOs, or to application sponsors (like a VP LOB, CMO) or to those that represent the Business Unit IT or engineers who report to the application sponsors.

These workload solutions often interact with the technical team but often also need the buy in of marketing, engineering, product design and in the case of media and entertainment, the studio.

## Preferred solution

*High-level architecture*

1.  Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for data loading, data preparation, storage, machine learning modeling, and reporting. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.

After speaking with its supportive team at Microsoft, ThoughtRender decided that Azure would, in fact, be the right choice for their platform. They decided to load data into blob storage; explore and prepare it using StorageExplorer and Azure CLI; execute their compute workload with Azure Batch; consider integrations with existing tools and apps their rendering users already have; and visualize and collaborate on remote workstations using Azure NV compute instances, with optional software from third-party providers.

![In the Preferred solution diagram Data upload to Azure utilizes Azure CLI and Azure StorageExplorer. Azure Batch Compute includes Azure Storage, and Data Output / Visualization has a NV Workstation.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BigComputeimages/media/image3.png "Preferred solution diagram")

**NOTE**: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

*Data loading*

1.  How would you recommend ThoughtRender get their data into (and out of) Azure? What services would you suggest and what are the specific steps they would need to take to prepare the data, to transfer the data, and where would the loaded data land?

    ThoughtRender should consider using the Microsoft Azure Import/Export service, or the Azure Data Box. Data will be loaded on-premises at ThoughtRender to hard drives provided by either service. These hard drives will then be sent to chosen/agreed Microsoft Azure datacenters, and data loaded directly to the customer\'s Azure tenant, typically into a Blob storage account. No special preparation of the data may be required, other than whatever file structure may facilitate the customer\'s workflow easiest in Azure (e.g., input and output folders).

*Video and Image Processing*

1.  What software tools will be used here? Are they commercial, or Open Source, or a combination of both? Will ThoughtRender need to throw away the tools they are already using, or are some integrations possible?

    Typically, there will be a combination of both Open Source and commercial tools. Open Source tools used for image/video processing include FFmpeg and Blender. Commercial software tools used in rendering may include Maya, RedShift. ThoughtRender does not need to throw away what applications they are using -- various levels of integration and support may be available with Azure for their applications, and this should be assessed on an app by app basis. Open Source tools (Linux or Windows based) are welcome and usable on Azure.

2.  For Linux based tools, does it matter which flavor of Linux is chosen?

    Typically, yes, it is a good idea to check the (1) flavor/distribution and (2) version of Linux that is being used to support the applications (e.g., CentOS, version 7.2). There may be multiple versions of Linux in use at the customer for different applications, but this may also be due to lack of maintenance/organization, in which case it could be a good opportunity to help standardize on a single distribution/version to use in this Azure project -- as long as their chosen applications support it.

3.  When are these tools used at ThoughtRender? Are they part of a workflow?

    Typically all of these software tools are used as part of a \"workflow\" at the company (i.e., from idea to finished project), and it is important to know at which part of the workflow the tool is used, and how this may fit with other applications. This may be important, for example, for understanding data transfer/flow. The output from one application may need to be stored on storage which is shared, to be used as input for another application. A typical Video Production pipeline (including some typical software tools) is as in the following diagram:

![The Typical Production pipeline diagram is broken into Pre-production, production, and post-production. Pre-production includes concept, script, storyboard, animatic design, special effects, and 3-D layout. Production includes modelling, animation, and shading and lighting. and rendering. post-production includes compositing, post-processing, and output to media.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-BigComputeimages/media/image4.png "Typical Production pipeline diagram")

*Batch Computing*

1.  What technology would you recommend ThoughtRender use for implementing their rendering compute workloads in Azure?

    Azure Batch Rendering -- a combination of IaaS compute resources, managed by Azure Batch (i.e., to start/stop compute resources to complete a rendering workload), and integrated where possible with software rendering tools such as Blender or Maya.

2.  Are there particular types of compute instances you would guide ThoughtRender to use?

    Rendering is a compute-heavy activity (physics calculations used to simulate light passing to/through objects in 3D), with a requirement for fast storage to read/write individual frames of video as the rendering activity works through a sequence of video. Frames (i.e., the input/output data for the physics calculation) can be easily \"split up\" between compute nodes, and are not dependent on each other -- this means there is typically little requirement for specialized (i.e., Infiniband) networking for inter-communication during the render.

3.  Are compute-intensive, memory-intensive, disk-intensive, or network-optimized instances needed?

    Compute-intensive instances (e.g., H16, A9) are needed. Fast SSD disk, or \"medium\" memory sizes may be required, depending on the software used. Special networking is not typically required.

4.  Are GPU based instances needed?

    If the software involved natively makes use of GPUs (e.g., Commercial software RedShift), then yes, these could be needed -- typically the NC series (i.e., NVIDIA GPU \"compute\" focused instances). Otherwise, typically, GPUs are not needed.

5.  How would you guide ThoughtRender to load data so it can be processed by the rendering compute workload?

    Typically the data should be loaded into a \"fast\" storage share (e.g., perhaps a BeeGFS or Lustre Parallel File System) -- as it may be read/written to in parallel by multiple compute nodes at the same time during rendering. Performance of this storage will be key to the overall completion time for rendering. For standard image processing, if the images or frames can be contained within storage on a compute node, then an ordinary storage share (e.g., SMB) can be used from which to load the data. Then the local SSD storage on the compute node can be used during the actual compute processing, with output written back to the SMB share at the end of the processing.

6.  How will this data be used at the beginning, middle, and end of a compute workload?

    Typically, initial input data may first be made available on a file share (e.g. SMB). Compute nodes, during a compute workload, may copy this data to local disk, and then process against local disk during the workload. At the end of the workload, the resulting data (or changed data) can be saved back to the same initial file share, or an alternative file share. It is always a good idea to double-check details of the exact workload during design.

7.  Where will this data be stored?

    Typically data can be stored on a file share (e.g., SMB). During a compute run, it may be more practical and performant to copy/store this data on a parallel filesystem (e.g., Lustre or BeeGFS), or to local SSD disk on the compute nodes -- typically described as "scratch" disk.

8.  Will this data be stored on compute instances during a batch run? Would you store data on each compute node working in a batch, or would you store data in a shared area?

    The answer depends on the workload. For compute rendering, it may be best to storage the data in a shared area (i.e., parallel filesystem or SMB storage share). For image processing, data during a batch run may be OK to be stored on local SSD disk attached to the compute nodes -- used only for the duration of the batch workload.

9.  What sort of performance will be required from this storage?

    It is a good idea to check/benchmark this against what the customer currently uses. However, overall, the storage used should be able to "feed" all of the compute nodes for the duration of the run, such that the compute cores on the compute nodes are fully utilized.

10.  Will this data need to be backed up or archived?

     Data during a compute run is typically referred to as "scratch" data, and may not be needed after the compute run, and can be discarded. Care should be taken that the output of the compute run is stored/saved elsewhere before the "scratch" storage used during the compute run is destroyed. Depending on the use case, it may be practical to "archive" all of the compute run data, including the interim data normally thrown away -- this may save time to recall later if a project needs to be re-done.

*Operationalizing and Integrating*

1.  Is it possible for ThoughtRender to connect their Batch Rendering workloads in Azure, to their Rendering workloads on-premises, in their various sites? If so, will the connection be made at a networking level, an operating system level, or an application level?

    Yes, typically this is possible. The connection is typically made at the application level (assuming a network connection such as VPN is already in place). Check what type of HPC compute cluster that ThoughtRender uses on-premises, and check the scheduling and batch software they use on those systems. Some of this software (e.g., HPC Pack, IBM LSF, Slurm, Univa GridEngine) have integrations possible with Azure to allow \"bursting\" (i.e., keeping head node control on-premises, and sending compute jobs to compute nodes running on Azure -- basically extending the on-premises HPC cluster into the cloud).

2.  Is it possible for ThoughtRender to keep their Azure infrastructure separate (i.e., completely unconnected) to their on-premises HPC clusters?

    Yes, this is typically possible and is usually easier than configuring a \"burst\" connection or integration with existing on-premises software. Separate clusters can be created in Azure, and configuration easily repeated or applied using Azure ARM templates, or using CycleCloud software.

*Visualization and Remote Workstations*

1. Are special types of compute instances needed for remote workstations in Azure?

    Yes, the "NV" (NVIDIA Visualisation) compute instances should be used. These contain special NVIDIA GRID technology graphics cards (e.g., NVIDIA M60), specialized for visualizations and remote workstation use.

2. Is a special type of software required for client access? Could users simply use remote desktop? Would this perform the way ThoughtRender (or their customers) would like it to?

    This depends on the applications and users involved. But typically, for \"high end\" workstation users (i.e., who may already use high powered workstations with GPUs installed), specialized software is needed for best performing remote desktop technology. Example: for interacting with 3D models in a performant way, a \"low latency\" is needed for usable interaction. Partner solution software and technology in this space includes Teradici and Citrix HDX. This software has already been proven in such scenarios for other customers. Teradici uses \"PCoIP\" (PC over IP) technology, which sends only \"changed\" pixels between workstation and display. A physical thin client connected to large monitors, or a software client installed on, e.g., a laptop connected to large monitors, can be used as a remote desktop client.

3. Would it be secure?

    Yes, Teradici PCoIP technology sends only "changed" pixels from workstation to display, and encrypts the pixels during transfer.

4. Would it be color correct?

    Teradici ensures color correctness, which may be important for some types of users.

5. Would it perform?

    The idea to use specialized software (e.g., like Teradici or Citrix HDX) is typically driven by the need to perform and perform better than typical remote desktop.

6. Would it allow collaboration or interactivity?

    Not all specialized software may facilitate collaboration (i.e., multiple users sharing a screen), and not all software will provide the \"low latency\" needed to interact with the software in a performant way for the users involved. Different software solutions provided by our partners cover some or all of these scenarios in different ways.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1. Will Azure give us control to schedule jobs when we want?

    Yes. With Azure Batch, jobs can be queued as normal, or sent to a queue and completed at desired times of the day.

2. Will the capacity be available on Azure when we want it?

    Typically, yes! This is the benefit of using a large public cloud provider with resources at scale. However, firstly, there are default limits for specific resources in an Azure subscription, which can easily be removed upon request. Secondly, for specialized compute instances, currently, there may be restrictions in certain datacenter locations, at particular scales. See public SLAs on the Microsoft website regarding our service delivery, and consult your local HPC specialists at Microsoft if you have any concerns regarding the scale/type of your workload.

3. We heard Microsoft does Linux now. But how true is this? Will it work with our chosen Linux version?

    Yes. Microsoft loves Linux! A commitment has been made by Microsoft to make Linux (and wider Open Source technologies) "a first class citizen\" on Azure. Microsoft has relationships with the major Enterprise Linux vendors (i.e., Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical), at various levels and teams, and specific integrations. For example, Microsoft and Red Hat have a relationship (2017) such that you can call Microsoft with a Red Hat query, and have this handled by Red Hat support staff working in Microsoft support centers. You can choose to run Azure Marketplace images of various Linux distributions/versions, and you can also BYOL (Bring Your Own License) for Enterprise Linux versions you own.

4. We have petabytes of data on-premises. It would cost us a fortune and take ages to move this to the cloud!

    Yes, this can pose an issue. However -- there are various methods of transferring data. In the first instance, if copying data over a standard Internet connection does not perform (e.g., direct or with VPN), a dedicated connection to Azure (ExpressRoute) may help. Secondly, optimized tools exist for transferring data -- with huge performance improvements. This includes Azcopy (an open source tool from Microsoft), or commercial tools such as Signiant, Aspera, or FileCatalyst. These tools in combination with dedicated connections may provide fast enough alternatives in given time frames. Thirdly, dedicated services exist for bulk transfers of large data, such as the Azure Data Box. This involves shipping hard drives of data from your data center, to Microsoft data centers. Finally, if it is possible to start with the data in Azure, then the cost of moving is substantially reduced -- and perhaps this may be possible for new projects starting from scratch (and, e.g., for old projects to remain on-premises).

5.  We heard collaboration is possible for 3D imaging workstations. But we have very specific color requirements and buy top-end workstation equipment for our users. Our users just wouldn't get the interaction performance they require with something \"remote\" in the cloud.

    With specific software tools from our partners such as Teradici, specialized solutions exist for exactly this requirement.

6.  Will this take jobs away from our IT system administrators and HPC engineers?

    No. IT system administrators can still maintain the systems in Azure, giving the users and the business insight via monitoring, logs, and can more easily respond to requests for new systems. HPC engineers can focus on taking advantage of the latest technologies in Azure to improve performance.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

*"With Big Compute power via Azure at our fingertips, we can control our delivery -- large or small, slow or fast -- for our customers, as well as allowing our team to collaborate and share better, focusing less on fixing hardware, and more on thinking and rendering!\"*
